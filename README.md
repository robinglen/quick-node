# quick-node

Tool to quickly start node projects

## What does it do?

* Create a `.gitignore` from gitignore.io, if you're offline it will create from a backup.
* Create a `.nvmrc` with the currently used node version.
* Create a MIT `LICENSE` with current year.
* Create a `package.json` with project name, description, a project name for GIT and mjs module flags.
* Create a `README.md` with the project name and description.

## TODO

* Configure JEST testing scripts
* Node debug mode scripts
* Live reloading?
* Different configurations for different type of apps?
